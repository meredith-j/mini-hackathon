⚡️ Gotta catch 'em all! ⚡️

This project was a five hour hackathon - a group of three devs got to create whatever website they would like using vanilla JS and at least one API. My group chose to use the Pokemon and Giphy APIs to create a fully responsive "Guess the Pokemon" app with a twist -- there's no way to get the Pokemon right. This was meant to be a fun practical joke you could use to infuriate your Pokemon-obsessed friends at parties.
